  # The 'results' method is the brains behind the time complexity analysis.

  # that they want to test multiple size arrays with the given algorithm.
  # The method then runs the submitted code with various size arrays, ranging from 100 up to 3000.
  # The data is saved as an array of x, y coordinates. x indicates the amount of data,
  # and y indicates the number of steps it takes for the code to actually run.
